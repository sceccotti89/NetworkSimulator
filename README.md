# NetworkSimulator

This project is still under construction.
In case you decide to use it, pay attention to the behaviour of the event generator.
When the generator starts to generate events it starts at time 0 even if the first event should be generated at a different time.
My suggestion is to start generate events at time 0 in any case.
